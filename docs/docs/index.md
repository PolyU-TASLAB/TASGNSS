# TASGNSS

This is a GNSS positioning utility that implements Weighted Least Squares (WLS) positioning algorithm.

## Overview

The tool processes GNSS observations to calculate receiver position, velocity, and clock parameters using WLS method. It supports multiple GNSS systems and includes necessary corrections for practical applications.

## Key Features

- Weighted Least Squares positioning
- Support for multiple GNSS constellations
- Atmospheric delay corrections (ionospheric and tropospheric)
- Satellite clock and relativistic effects correction
- Iterative solution until convergence

## Documentation

For detailed technical information about the WLS algorithm and GNSS corrections, please see the [Appendix](appendix.md).
